# FAQ Chatbot

This repository contains code for a simple FAQ chatbot designed to answer questions related to the Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP 2023).

## Overview

The FAQ chatbot is built using TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequence prediction. It's trained on a dataset consisting of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers related to the DSMP 2023.

## Contents

- `faq_chatbot.py`: Python script containing the code for training the FAQ chatbot.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Requirements

To run the FAQ chatbot script, you need:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for experimenting with the code)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSMP-2023-FAQ-Chatbot.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd DSMP-2023-FAQ-Chatbot
    ```

3. Run the `faq_chatbot.py` script:

    ```bash
    python faq_chatbot.py
    ```

    Once the script is executed, the model will start training. You can adjust the number of epochs and other parameters as needed.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the dataset and training parameters in the `faq_chatbot.py` script. Additionally, you can experiment with different network architectures or pre-processing techniques to improve performance.
